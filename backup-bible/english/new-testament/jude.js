      "text": "This letter is from me, Jude. I am Jesus Christ's servant and I am James's brother. I am writing to you people that God, the Father, loves. God has chosen you to be his own people. He is keeping you safe until the time when Jesus Christ returns. Most people think that Jude (also called Judas) was Jesus' brother. James and Jude were two of Jesus' four brothers. See Mark James became a leader of the Christians at Jerusalem. See Galatians and Acts But, in his letter, Jude does not say that he was Jesus' brother. He thought about himself as Jesus' servant. Jesus became his Master. Jude wanted people to obey Jesus. He did not want people to think that he himself was very important."

But instead of that, I now know that I must write to you about something else. I must tell you to be strong and brave. You must do everything that you can to keep God's true message safe. God has given this message to his special people and his message will never change. Do not let anyone teach you a different message."

They teach that we can do any evil things that we want to do. They say that God will be kind and he will forgive us for all those things. They do not accept the authority of Jesus Christ, who is our only Master and our Lord. God will certainly punish those wicked people. A long time ago God said that he would punish people like them."

      "text": "Also remember that some angels refused to obey God. They took more authority for themselves than God had given them. They left their own proper place with God in heaven. So God has tied them up as prisoners for ever in a completely dark place. He will keep them there until that great day when he will judge everyone. Israel's people were slaves in Egypt. God saved them when Moses led them out from there. But as they travelled through the wilderness, most of them did not trust God. So they did not go into the land that God had promised them. Instead, they died before they arrived there. That is how God punished them. See Numbers Some of the angels in heaven thought that they were very important. So they stopped obeying God and they left heaven. See Genesis Luke and Revelation"

      "text": "Also, remember what happened to the cities called Sodom and Gomorrah, and the other cities that were near them. Like those bad angels, the people who lived in those places were also doing evil things. They were having sex with people who were not their husbands or their wives. They liked to have sex in other ways that are not right. God destroyed their cities. He has punished them with fire that never stops burning. That is an example of what will happen to wicked people like them. Jude uses Sodom and Gomorrah as examples of places where people did bad things. See Genesis"

But even when the Devil said bad words against God, Michael himself did not speak against the Devil. He did not think that he should do that. Instead, Michael said, ‘The Lord himself will show that you are wrong.’"

Like Korah, they have refused to obey God. So God will destroy them. Cain killed his brother Abel. See Genesis Hebrews John Balaam caused Israel's people to do bad things. See Numbers 22-25; Deuteronomy Revelation Korah thought that he himself was very important. He thought that he knew better than Moses. He refused to obey what God had told Moses. See Numbers The false teachers are very dangerous"

They come only because they want to eat too much. They do not respect God or other people. They only think about themselves and they are not ashamed. They are like clouds that you think will bring rain. But the wind blows those clouds along and there is no rain. They are like trees that have no fruit, even at the time for harvest. People pull trees like that out of the ground. They are completely dead and can give no fruit."

They speak great things about themselves, to show how important they are. They praise other people only so that they can get something good for themselves. Enoch was a man who lived many, many years ago. He lived in a good way that pleased God. See Genesis These words that Enoch wrote are not in the Bible. Enoch wrote them in a book called ‘The Book of Enoch’. Christians must continue to trust God"
