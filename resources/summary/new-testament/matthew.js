    1: `Matthew begins his Gospel by showing that Jesus comes from the true royal family line of Israel. He lists the family genealogy starting from Abraham, the father of the Jewish people, down through King David, and finally all the way to Joseph, who was the husband of Mary.
This long list is not just history—Matthew is proving that Jesus is the promised Messiah, the descendant of both Abraham and David, exactly as God had promised in the Old Testament.
After the genealogy, Matthew explains how the birth of Jesus happened. Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she became pregnant. This was not a normal pregnancy—the baby was conceived by the Holy Spirit. Joseph, a kind and righteous man, did not want to humiliate her publicly. At the same time, he was confused and did not know what to do, so he decided to quietly break the engagement.
But one night, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream. The angel told him not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife because the child in her womb was from God, through the Holy Spirit. The angel also gave the baby's name: Jesus, which means "The Lord saves." The angel explained that Jesus would save His people from their sins.
Matthew then shows how this event fulfilled a prophecy spoken long ago by Isaiah:
"A virgin will become pregnant, she will give birth to a son, and He will be called Immanuel," which means "God with us."
Matthew wants us to understand that Jesus' birth was the moment when God came close to humanity in a new and powerful way.
When Joseph woke up, he immediately obeyed the angel. He took Mary as his wife, protected her, and cared for her. But Joseph did not sleep with her until after Jesus was born, keeping her pregnancy holy and according to God's plan. And finally, Joseph gave the baby the name Jesus, just as the angel had commanded.`
