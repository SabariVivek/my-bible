Sometimes people write it as ‘Yahweh’, or as ‘Jehovah’. It is his own name that he told Moses. See Exodus It means ‘I am who I am’. This shows that God has always been there and he always will be there. We have heard a message from the Lord. Someone has taken a message to the nations to say, ‘Stand up and fight against Edom.’"
