Then Jesus said to Peter, ‘Follow me.’ Jesus asked Peter three times, ‘Do you love me?’ Before Jesus died, Peter had said three times that he did not know Jesus. This may be the reason why Jesus asked the question three times. Jesus was telling Peter that Peter would die on a cross, with his arms on each side. He would die in the same way that Jesus had died."
