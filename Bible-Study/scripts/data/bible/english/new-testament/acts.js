They thought that they had made something that was very good.",

But you did not really worship me when you did that.",

    "verse_18": "There were some teachers there who liked to talk about the things that people should believe. Some of them were called Epicureans and some were called Stoics. After they talked to Paul, some of them said to each other, ‘Who is this silly man? He knows nothing and he talks too much!’ But some of these teachers said, ‘We think that he is talking about strange gods.’ They said this because Paul was telling people the good news about Jesus.

    "verse_26": "God first made one man. From that one man he made all the different groups of people. He caused them to live in different places all over the world. He decided where each group of people should live. He also decided how long they should live in each place.",
    "verse_27": "God did all this so that people would want to know him. They would look carefully for him and perhaps they would find him. Really, God is near to each of us.",

    "verse_29": "So, because we are God's children, we should not think that he is a thing like an idol. Clever people use gold or silver or stone to make images of gods. But God is not like these things that people choose to make for themselves.",
    "verse_30": "In past times people did not know the true things about God. Because of this, God did not punish them. But now God tells people everywhere, “Stop doing bad things and turn to me!”",
    "verse_31": "God has already chosen one special day. On that day he will judge everyone in the world in a completely right way. He has chosen a man who will do this for him. He has shown clearly to everyone who that man is. He showed it like this: People killed that man. But God caused him to live again.’",
    "verse_32": "Paul had said, ‘God caused that man to live again.’ When the people heard this, some of them laughed at him. But other people said to Paul, ‘We want you to tell us more about this on another day.’",
    "verse_33": "So then Paul left the meeting of the important officers of the city.",
    "verse_34": "Some of the people who had heard Paul's message joined his group. They believed the good news about Jesus. One of these believers was a man called Dionysius. He belonged to the group of important officers. A woman called Damaris also became a believer. Several other people also believed Paul's message about Jesus."

Then pay the priest the money for their sacrifices. After that, the men can cut the hair off their heads. When you do that, everyone will understand about you. They will see what you have done. They will know that you yourself obey the Law of Moses. They will know that what they have heard about you is not true.",

He did not know what had really happened. So he said to his soldiers, ‘Take this man up into our strong building!’",

    "verse_6": "So what is the reason that I stand here today for you to judge me? It is because I believe in God's promise to our ancestors.",
    "verse_7": "He promised a great thing to our 12 Israelite families. We all expect to receive what God has promised to us. That is why we Jews always worship God, in the day and in the night.

    "verse_11": "I went to our Jewish meeting places to take hold of believers. I told my men to punish them. I tried to make the believers say bad things against God. I was very angry with them. So I even travelled to cities in other countries to punish them.",

I say the same thing to people who are very important and to people who are not important. I am telling you the same things that Moses and God's other prophets wrote about. They also said that these things would happen.",
    "verse_23": "They said that God's special Messiah would have much pain and he would die. But God would raise him up to be alive again. He would be the first dead person to become alive and not die again. In that way, he would show God's message and bring light to people. He would save both Jewish people and Gentiles. That is what the prophets and Moses wrote. And I say the same thing.’",

    "verse_2": "We went onto a ship that had come from Adramyttium. This ship was ready to leave. It would sail to the towns on the coast of Asia region. A man called Aristarchus also sailed with us. He came from a city in Macedonia called Thessalonica.",

    "verse_7": "We sailed slowly for several days. It was difficult to sail, but after some time we arrived near the town of Cnidus. Because of the strong wind, we could not continue to sail in that direction. So we sailed along the side of the island called Crete, where the wind was not strong. We sailed past the point of land called Salmone.",
    "verse_8": "It was still difficult to sail, so we sailed near to the coast. Then we arrived at a place called ‘Safe Port’. This port was near to the town of Lasea.",
    "verse_9": "We remained there for many days. By then it had become dangerous to continue the journey. It was already after the Day of Atonement. So Paul spoke to the army officer and to the sailors.",
    "verse_10": "He said, ‘Friends, I understand that now our journey will be dangerous. The ship may break in pieces. You may lose the things that the ship is carrying. All of us may even die.’",

    "verse_12": "This port was not a good place for a ship to remain during the winter. Most of the men on the ship wanted to continue the journey. They wanted to sail as far as Phoenix, if they could get there. They could stay there for the winter. Phoenix was a port on the island called Crete. It was open to the sea both to the south-west and to the north-west.",
    "verse_13": "The wind began to blow from the south, but it was not strong. So the sailors thought, ‘Now we can do what we wanted to do. We can sail to Phoenix.’ So they pulled up the ship's anchor and left the port. Then we sailed as near as we could to the coast of Crete.",
    "verse_14": "But soon a very strong wind began to blow. This wind blew from the north-east and it blew strongly across the island.",
    "verse_15": "The storm hit the ship very powerfully. It was not possible for the sailors to sail the ship straight into the wind. So they did not try to do that any more. Instead, they let the wind blow the ship along.",
    "verse_16": "After that, we passed the south end of a small island called Cauda. Here we found a place where the wind did not blow so strongly. The sailors lifted the ship's small boat out of the water to make it safe.",
    "verse_17": "They tied it on the ship with ropes. Then they tied some more ropes under the ship so that it would not break in pieces. The men were afraid of what might happen. There were some places along the coast of Libya where the water was not very deep. The ship might hit one of these places and then it might break. So they took the ship's largest sail down. Then they let the wind blow the ship along.",
    "verse_18": "The strong storm continued to blow against the ship. The ship was carrying many things. So the next day, the sailors threw some of these things into the sea.",
    "verse_19": "The day after that, they took hold of the sails and ropes and they threw them into the sea.",

    "verse_22": "Now I ask you, please be brave. The storm will completely destroy the ship, but not one of you will die.",
    "verse_23": "Last night one of God's angels spoke to me. I am a servant of God and I belong to him. He sent his angel to come to me.",

    "verse_27": "The storm had continued for 14 days and nights. The strong wind was blowing the ship across the Mediterranean Sea. About midnight, the sailors thought that we were near to the land.",
    "verse_28": "So they used a rope to measure how deep the water was. They saw that the water was nearly 40 metres deep. A short time later they did this again. This time the water was only 30 metres deep.",
    "verse_29": "The sailors were afraid that the ship would hit some rocks. So they dropped four anchors on ropes from the back of the ship into the sea. After that, they prayed that dawn would come soon.",
    "verse_30": "Some of the sailors tried to leave the ship. They put the small boat into the sea. They tried to go away secretly. They said, ‘We are going to the front of the ship to put some more anchors down into the sea.’ But that was not true.",
    "verse_31": "Paul said to the army officer and to the soldiers, ‘These sailors must stay on the ship. If they do not stay, you will not be safe. You will die.’",
    "verse_32": "So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the small boat to the ship. The small boat fell into the water and the wind blew it away.",
    "verse_33": "Now it was almost dawn. Paul said to everyone, ‘Please eat some food. You have now waited for 14 days for the storm to stop. You did not know what would happen. You have not eaten anything during all that time.",
    "verse_34": "You must eat some food now. Then you will be strong enough to stay alive. None of you will die. You will not even lose one hair from your head.’",
    "verse_35": "After Paul said this, he took some bread in his hands. He stood in front of them all and he thanked God for the bread. Then he broke the bread into pieces and he began to eat it.",
    "verse_36": "Everyone became less afraid and we all ate some food.",
    "verse_37": "There were 276 people on the ship.",
    "verse_38": "After everyone had eaten enough, the sailors threw bags of wheat off the ship into the sea. Then the ship was not so heavy.",
    "verse_39": "In the morning, the ship was near to some land, but the sailors did not recognize the place. They saw a place on the shore where there was a lot of sand. They wanted to drive the ship onto the sand.",
    "verse_40": "So the sailors cut the ropes which had the anchors on them. They left the anchors there in the sea. They also removed the ropes which had tied the rudders. Then they raised the sail at the front of the ship. Now the wind could blow the ship straight towards the shore.",
    "verse_41": "But there was a place in the sea where the water was not deep. The ship sailed onto the sand in this place and it stayed there. The front of the ship pushed into the sand and it could not move. The sea was very strong and it hit against the back of the ship. As a result, the back of the ship broke into pieces.",
    "verse_42": "The soldiers decided to kill the prisoners that they were guarding. They did not want these men to swim to the land and escape.",
    "verse_43": "But the army officer wanted to save Paul. So he commanded the soldiers not to kill the men. Instead he said, ‘Everyone who can swim, jump into the water first. Then swim to the shore.",

He did not die in the sea but now the snake will kill him. The god who punishes people for the bad things that they do will not let him live.’",

I tell you that I have never done anything bad against our people. I have always obeyed the rules that our ancestors gave to us. But the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem took hold of me. They gave me to the Roman rulers so that they would judge me.",

    "verse_19": "But the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem did not agree with that. So then I asked the Roman rulers to send me here to Rome. I wanted Caesar himself to judge me. That was the only thing that I could do. I did not want to say anything bad against my own people.",

Paul talked to them from the morning until the evening. He explained his message about the kingdom of God. He showed them what Moses and the other prophets had written in the Bible.
