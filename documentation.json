      "content": "<!--StartFragment--><h2>🕊️ 1. Jesus Fulfilled the Law Completely</h2>\n<h3>📖 Matthew 5:17–18</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; <strong>I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</strong><br>\nFor truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, <strong>not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ Jesus didn’t <em>cancel</em> the Law — He <strong>fulfilled</strong> every prophecy, requirement, and symbol. Once fulfilled, it’s <strong>accomplished</strong> — no longer binding in the same way.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>✝️ 2. The Law Was a Shadow, Christ Is the Reality</h2>\n<h3>📖 Colossians 2:16–17</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.<br>\n<strong>These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ The Old Testament laws (like Sabbath or Passover) were <strong>shadows</strong> pointing to Jesus. Once the <strong>substance (Christ)</strong> came, the shadows no longer bind us.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>⚖️ 3. We Are Not Under the Law But Under Grace</h2>\n<h3>📖 Romans 6:14</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“For sin shall no longer be your master, because <strong>you are not under the law, but under grace.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ The law <em>once</em> defined sin and judgment, but in Christ we are under <strong>grace</strong> — a new covenant relationship, not legal obligation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>📜 4. Christ Ended the Law’s Rule Over Us</h2>\n<h3>📖 Romans 10:4</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<strong>Christ is the end of the law</strong> for righteousness to everyone who believes.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ The word “end” (Greek: <em>telos</em>) means <em>completion</em> or <em>goal</em>. Christ brought the Law’s purpose to completion — righteousness now comes <strong>through faith</strong>, not by law-keeping.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>🔥 5. The Law Was Our Guardian Only Until Christ Came</h2>\n<h3>📖 Galatians 3:23–25</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law…<br>\nSo the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith.<br>\nNow that this faith has come, <strong>we are no longer under a guardian.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ The Law served a temporary purpose — to lead us to Christ. Once He came, that “guardian” role ended.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>💔 6. Don’t Return to the Old Law</h2>\n<h3>📖 Galatians 5:1–4</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and <strong>do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.</strong><br>\n…If you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.<br>\nYou who are trying to be justified by the law <strong>have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ Anyone trying to keep the old laws as a requirement for salvation <strong>rejects Christ’s completed work</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>🌿 7. A New Covenant Replaced the Old</h2>\n<h3>📖 Hebrews 8:13</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“By calling this covenant ‘new,’ He has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ The Mosaic Covenant (with all its laws) was <strong>replaced</strong> by the New Covenant through Jesus’ blood.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>🩸 8. The Law Could Never Perfect, Only Jesus Could</h2>\n<h3>📖 Hebrews 10:1</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves.<br>\nIt can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, <strong>make perfect those who draw near to worship.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ The Law’s rituals could never save — Jesus’ sacrifice did, once and for all.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>🔓 9. Freedom in Christ, Not Bondage to the Law</h2>\n<h3>📖 Galatians 5:13</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be <strong>free</strong>. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>➡ Our freedom is not license to sin — it’s freedom <strong>from legal bondage</strong>, to now walk in the Spirit and love.</p><!--EndFragment--><div><!--EndFragment--></div>"
