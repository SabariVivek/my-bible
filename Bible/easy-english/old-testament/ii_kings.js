    "verse_3": "Then the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah. He was a prophet who came from Tishbe. The angel said, ‘Go and meet the men that the king of Samaria has sent.

He says to you, “This is what the Lord says: Why have you sent men to speak to Ekron's god, Baal-Zebub? You seem to think that there is no God in Israel.

    "verse_17": "So Ahaziah died. The Lord had told Elijah that this would happen. Ahaziah had no son, so his brother, Joram, became king after him. This happened in the second year that Jehoshaphat's son, Jehoram, ruled Judah as king.",
