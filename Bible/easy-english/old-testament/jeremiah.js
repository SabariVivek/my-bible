    "verse_2": "Look up at the tops of the hills. You have loved other gods on all of them! You sat by the side of the road, and you waited for a lover to come. Like a robber, you waited to catch men so that you could sleep with them. You have not been faithful to me, but you have looked for other gods, like a prostitute. The wicked things that you have done have made the land unclean.",

    "verse_24": "Since we were a young nation, we have seen all our good things disappear. The useless gods that we worshipped have taken them. They took away the things that our ancestors worked to get. They took away our sheep and our cows. They even took away our sons and our daughters.",
    "verse_25": "We are ashamed to agree that this is true. We must accept the shame that we deserve. We and our ancestors have done bad things against the Lord our God. Since long ago, we have not obeyed him, and even today, we still do not listen to him.” ’"
