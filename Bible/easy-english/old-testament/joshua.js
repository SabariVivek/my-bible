    "verse_16": "the water stopped. It stopped a long way up the river, at a town called Adam. That is near Zarethan. The water going down to the Salt Sea stopped completely. So the people crossed the river near Jericho city.",
    "verse_17": "The priests stood in the middle of the river on dry ground, with the Lord's Covenant Box. While they stood there, all the Israelite people walked across the river on dry ground. In that way, the whole nation arrived on the other side of the river."

    "verse_1": "Many people heard how the Lord had caused the Jordan River to become dry. This included all the Amorite kings on the west side of the Jordan River, and all the Canaanite kings who lived near the sea. They heard how the Lord had made the river become dry until all the Israelites had crossed to the other side. So the kings became very afraid of the Israelite people. They felt too weak to fight against them.",
    "verse_2": "The Lord said to Joshua at that time, ‘Make knives of stone and circumcise the Israelite men.’",

    "verse_5": "All those men who came out of Egypt had already been circumcised. But all the sons who were born on the journey through the desert had not been circumcised.",
    "verse_6": "The Israelites had travelled in the desert for 40 years. But all the men who were old enough to fight when they left Egypt had now died. This happened because they had not obeyed the Lord. The Lord had promised to give to them the land of Canaan, a land where there is plenty of food and drink. But he made a strong promise that those men would not see that land, because they had turned against him.",
    "verse_7": "Now Joshua circumcised their sons, who had taken their place. Their fathers had not circumcised them while they travelled in the desert.",

    "verse_9": "The Lord said to Joshua, ‘This shows that you are no longer ashamed to be slaves, as you were in Egypt. Today I have taken away your shame.’ So they called that place Gilgal, and it still has that name.",

    "verse_11": "The next day they ate food that had grown in Canaan. For the first time, they ate flat bread and grain that they cooked on a fire.",
    "verse_12": "The manna that they had been eating no longer appeared. The Israelite people never ate manna again. Now they could eat the food that was grown in Canaan.",
    "verse_13": "While Joshua was near Jericho, a man appeared to him. Joshua looked up and there he was! He stood in front of Joshua with a sword in his hand. Joshua went towards him. He asked the man, ‘Are you here to help us, or to help our enemies?’",
    "verse_14": "The man answered, ‘Neither. I am the captain of the Lord's army. Now I am here!’ Joshua fell on the ground to worship the man and he said, ‘Sir, I am your servant. Tell me what I should do.’",

    "verse_16": "The seventh time, the priests made a long, loud noise on their trumpets. Joshua told the people, ‘Shout aloud to attack! The Lord has given the city to you!",
    "verse_17": "The city and everything that is in it belongs to the Lord, so destroy it all. Only the prostitute Rahab and all the people who are with her in her house will live. This is because she hid the two men that we sent.",
    "verse_18": "Be careful! Do not take for yourselves the valuable things that belong to the Lord. If you do that, you will cause bad trouble to come to the whole Israelite army. The Lord will destroy us all.",

    "verse_25": "But Joshua kept Rahab safe, as well as her family and everyone who belonged to her. Rahab had hidden the men that Joshua sent to find out about Jericho city. Because she did that, her family still lives among the Israelites, even today.",
    "verse_26": "At that time, Joshua made a strong promise. He said, ‘If anyone tries to build Jericho city again, the Lord will punish him as a guilty man. When he starts to build, his oldest son will die. When he puts up the city's gates, his youngest son will die.’",

    "verse_5": "They chased the Israelites away from the gate of the city and they killed about 36 Israelite soldiers. They chased them down the hill as far as Shebarim. They killed the Israelites as they ran down the hill. When the people of Israel heard this, they became very frightened.",
